# StartEase

StartEase is a web and mobile platform dedicated to managing "a diploma-a startup/a diploma-a patent" projects, as part of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research directives regarding the implementation of Ministerial Resolution 1275.

## Description

StartEase enables teachers and students about to graduate to submit their startup project ideas, which can be then approved by the scientific committee of their establishment. Supervisors will then monitor teams whose ideas have been accepted, until the internship service schedules a thesis defence for the project team. After the defence, deliberation results of each member will be published on the platform.
